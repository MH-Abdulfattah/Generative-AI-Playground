## Writing Better Prompts for Image Generation

To generate amazing images with [Bing's Image Creator](https://www.greataiprompts.com/guide/microsoft-bing-image-generator-what-is-it-how-to-use-it/), it's essential to provide detailed and creative prompts.

Bing suggests using a combination of adjectives, nouns, verbs, and styles to create more effective prompts.

Here's a template to help you craft better prompts:

**Adjective** (Fuzzy) + **Noun** (creature) + **Verb**(wearing glasses) + **Style** (digital art)

1. **Adjective** (e.g., Fuzzy)
2. **Noun** (e.g., creature)
3. **Verb** (e.g., wearing glasses)
4. **Style** (e.g., digital art)

The more specific and imaginative your prompts are, the better the AI-generated images will align with your vision. Remember, that while writing you cannot provide aspect ratios to Bing Image Creator as it always generates in a 1:1 or 3:4 ratio.

Please adjust the formatting as needed for your use case.
