It covers essential components such as topic selection, problem definition, literature review, research questions/hypotheses, methodology, data collection, analysis, results interpretation, discussion, conclusion, writing, formatting, peer review, revision, proofreading, submission, publication, dissemination, and impact tracking. This prompt explains the significance of each stage, outlines best practices, addresses potential challenges, and offers strategies for successful execution.
