# Tips to create powerful prompts

## 1. Be Precise and Specific
   - Clearly state what you want Copilot to do. Use specific keywords or phrases related to your task.
   - Instead of vague instructions, provide detailed context. For example, "Generate a Python function that sorts an array using quicksort algorithm" is more effective than "Sort an array."

## 2. Positive Instructions
   - Frame your prompt in a positive manner. Tell Copilot what you want it to do, rather than what you don‚Äôt want.
For instance, use ‚ÄúCreate a summary of this article‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt generate a lengthy response.‚Äù

## 3. Examples and Inputs/Outputs
   - Include examples of inputs and expected outputs. This helps Copilot understand your intent.
   - If you're asking Copilot to write code, provide sample input/output pairs or describe edge cases.

## 4. Use Natural Language
   - Write prompts as if you're conversing with a helpful coworker. Be clear and concise.
   - Imagine explaining the task to someone who doesn't know the specifics.

## 5. Iterate and Refine
   - If the initial result isn't what you wanted, iterate. Adjust your prompt to avoid mistakes.
   - Regenerate responses until you get the desired output.

Remember, effective prompts lead to better interactions with Copilot, making your tasks more efficient and creative! üöÄ‚ú®
